# Churn-Prediction-Model
This project predicts which bank customers are likely to churn (leave the bank) using machine learning models. Logistic Regression and Decision Tree classifiers were implemented after handling imbalanced data and performing exploratory data analysis.

# Customer Churn Prediction

##  Overview

This project aims to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. The task includes:
- Data cleaning & preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Handling imbalanced data with SMOTE
- Supervised machine learning using:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluating model performance
- Interpreting feature importance
---

**Objective:**  
Identify customers who are likely to leave the bank (churn) based on features.

## Dataset
- Dataset: *Churn_Modelling.csv*
- Source: Kaggle

---

## Tools Used

- Python  
- NumPy
- Pandas  
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- SMOTE

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualized gender, age, and geography vs churn.
- Found imbalance in target variable.
- Used SMOTE to balance churn classes before training.

---
## Conclusion

- Logistic Regression and Decision Tree both gave accuracy (75%).
- Churn prediction is a challenging task, especially with imbalanced data.
